my
fellow
citizens
events
in
iraq
have
now
reached
the
final
days
of
decision
for
more
than
a
decade
the
united
states
and
other
nations
have
pursued
patient
and
honorable
efforts
to
disarm
the
iraqi
regime
without
war
that
regime
pledged
to
reveal
and
destroy
all
its
weapons
of
mass
destruction
as
a
condition
for
ending
the
persian
gulf
war
in
1991
since
then
the
world
has
engaged
in
12
years
of
diplomacy
we
have
passed
more
than
a
dozen
resolutions
in
the
united
nations
security
council
we
have
sent
hundreds
of
weapons
inspectors
to
oversee
the
disarmament
of
iraq
our
good
faith
has
not
been
returned
the
iraqi
regime
has
used
diplomacy
as
a
ploy
to
gain
time
and
advantage
it
has
uniformly
defied
security
council
resolutions
demanding
full
disarmament
over
the
years
un
weapon
inspectors
have
been
threatened
by
iraqi
officials
electronically
bugged
and
systematically
deceived
peaceful
efforts
to
disarm
the
iraqi
regime
have
failed
again
and
again
because
we
are
not
dealing
with
peaceful
men
intelligence
gathered
by
this
and
other
governments
leaves
no
doubt
that
the
iraq
regime
continues
to
possess
and
conceal
some
of
the
most
lethal
weapons
ever
devised
this
regime
has
already
used
weapons
of
mass
destruction
against
iraqs
neighbors
and
against
iraqs
people
the
regime
has
a
history
of
reckless
aggression
in
the
middle
east
it
has
a
deep
hatred
of
america
and
our
friends
and
it
has
aided
trained
and
harbored
terrorists
including
operatives
of
al
qaeda
the
danger
is
clear
using
chemical
biological
or
one
day
nuclear
weapons
obtained
with
the
help
of
iraq
the
terrorists
could
fulfill
their
stated
ambitions
and
kill
thousands
or
hundreds
of
thousands
of
innocent
people
in
our
country
or
any
other
the
united
states
and
other
nations
did
nothing
to
deserve
or
invite
this
threat
but
we
will
do
everything
to
defeat
it
instead
of
drifting
along
toward
tragedy
we
will
set
a
course
toward
safety
before
the
day
of
horror
can
come
before
it
is
too
late
to
act
this
danger
will
be
removed
the
united
states
of
america
has
the
sovereign
authority
to
use
force
in
assuring
its
own
national
security
that
duty
falls
to
me
as
commanderinchief
by
the
oath
i
have
sworn
by
the
oath
i
will
keep
recognizing
the
threat
to
our
country
the
united
states
congress
voted
overwhelmingly
last
year
to
support
the
use
of
force
against
iraq
america
tried
to
work
with
the
united
nations
to
address
this
threat
because
we
wanted
to
resolve
the
issue
peacefully
we
believe
in
the
mission
of
the
united
nations
one
reason
the
un
was
founded
after
the
second
world
war
was
to
confront
aggressive
dictators
actively
and
early
before
they
can
attack
the
innocent
and
destroy
the
peace
in
the
case
of
iraq
the
security
council
did
act
in
the
early
1990s
under
resolutions
678
and
687
both
still
in
effect
the
united
states
and
our
allies
are
authorized
to
use
force
in
ridding
iraq
of
weapons
of
mass
destruction
this
is
not
a
question
of
authority
it
is
a
question
of
will
last
september
i
went
to
the
un
general
assembly
and
urged
the
nations
of
the
world
to
unite
and
bring
an
end
to
this
danger
on
november
8
the
security
council
unanimously
passed
resolution
1441
finding
iraq
in
material
breach
of
its
obligations
and
vowing
serious
consequences
if
iraq
did
not
fully
and
immediately
disarm
today
no
nation
can
possibly
claim
that
iraq
has
disarmed
and
it
will
not
disarm
so
long
as
saddam
hussein
holds
power
for
the
last
fourandahalf
months
the
united
states
and
our
allies
have
worked
within
the
security
council
to
enforce
that
councils
longstanding
demands
yet
some
permanent
members
of
the
security
council
have
publicly
announced
they
will
veto
any
resolution
that
compels
the
disarmament
of
iraq
these
governments
share
our
assessment
of
the
danger
but
not
our
resolve
to
meet
it
many
nations
however
do
have
the
resolve
and
fortitude
to
act
against
this
threat
to
peace
and
a
broad
coalition
is
now
gathering
to
enforce
the
just
demands
of
the
world
the
united
nations
security
council
has
not
lived
up
to
its
responsibilities
so
we
will
rise
to
ours
in
recent
days
some
governments
in
the
middle
east
have
been
doing
their
part
they
have
delivered
public
and
private
messages
urging
the
dictator
to
leave
iraq
so
that
disarmament
can
proceed
peacefully
he
has
thus
far
refused
all
the
decades
of
deceit
and
cruelty
have
now
reached
an
end
saddam
hussein
and
his
sons
must
leave
iraq
within
48
hours
their
refusal
to
do
so
will
result
in
military
conflict
commenced
at
a
time
of
our
choosing
for
their
own
safety
all
foreign
nationals
including
journalists
and
inspectors
should
leave
iraq
immediately
many
iraqis
can
hear
me
tonight
in
a
translated
radio
broadcast
and
i
have
a
message
for
them
if
we
must
begin
a
military
campaign
it
will
be
directed
against
the
lawless
men
who
rule
your
country
and
not
against
you
as
our
coalition
takes
away
their
power
we
will
deliver
the
food
and
medicine
you
need
we
will
tear
down
the
apparatus
of
terror
and
we
will
help
you
to
build
a
new
iraq
that
is
prosperous
and
free
in
a
free
iraq
there
will
be
no
more
wars
of
aggression
against
your
neighbors
no
more
poison
factories
no
more
executions
of
dissidents
no
more
torture
chambers
and
rape
rooms
the
tyrant
will
soon
be
gone
the
day
of
your
liberation
is
near
it
is
too
late
for
saddam
hussein
to
remain
in
power
it
is
not
too
late
for
the
iraqi
military
to
act
with
honor
and
protect
your
country
by
permitting
the
peaceful
entry
of
coalition
forces
to
eliminate
weapons
of
mass
destruction
our
forces
will
give
iraqi
military
units
clear
instructions
on
actions
they
can
take
to
avoid
being
attacked
and
destroyed
i
urge
every
member
of
the
iraqi
military
and
intelligence
services
if
war
comes
do
not
fight
for
a
dying
regime
that
is
not
worth
your
own
life
and
all
iraqi
military
and
civilian
personnel
should
listen
carefully
to
this
warning
in
any
conflict
your
fate
will
depend
on
your
action
do
not
destroy
oil
wells
a
source
of
wealth
that
belongs
to
the
iraqi
people
do
not
obey
any
command
to
use
weapons
of
mass
destruction
against
anyone
including
the
iraqi
people
war
crimes
will
be
prosecuted
war
criminals
will
be
punished
and
it
will
be
no
defense
to
say
i
was
just
following
orders
should
saddam
hussein
choose
confrontation
the
american
people
can
know
that
every
measure
has
been
taken
to
avoid
war
and
every
measure
will
be
taken
to
win
it
americans
understand
the
costs
of
conflict
because
we
have
paid
them
in
the
past
war
has
no
certainty
except
the
certainty
of
sacrifice
yet
the
only
way
to
reduce
the
harm
and
duration
of
war
is
to
apply
the
full
force
and
might
of
our
military
and
we
are
prepared
to
do
so
if
saddam
hussein
attempts
to
cling
to
power
he
will
remain
a
deadly
foe
until
the
end
in
desperation
he
and
terrorists
groups
might
try
to
conduct
terrorist
operations
against
the
american
people
and
our
friends
these
attacks
are
not
inevitable
they
are
however
possible
and
this
very
fact
underscores
the
reason
we
cannot
live
under
the
threat
of
blackmail
the
terrorist
threat
to
america
and
the
world
will
be
diminished
the
moment
that
saddam
hussein
is
disarmed
our
government
is
on
heightened
watch
against
these
dangers
just
as
we
are
preparing
to
ensure
victory
in
iraq
we
are
taking
further
actions
to
protect
our
homeland
in
recent
days
american
authorities
have
expelled
from
the
country
certain
individuals
with
ties
to
iraqi
intelligence
services
among
other
measures
i
have
directed
additional
security
of
our
airports
and
increased
coast
guard
patrols
of
major
seaports
the
department
of
homeland
security
is
working
closely
with
the
nations
governors
to
increase
armed
security
at
critical
facilities
across
america
should
enemies
strike
our
country
they
would
be
attempting
to
shift
our
attention
with
panic
and
weaken
our
morale
with
fear
in
this
they
would
fail
no
act
of
theirs
can
alter
the
course
or
shake
the
resolve
of
this
country
we
are
a
peaceful
people
yet
were
not
a
fragile
people
and
we
will
not
be
intimidated
by
thugs
and
killers
if
our
enemies
dare
to
strike
us
they
and
all
who
have
aided
them
will
face
fearful
consequences
we
are
now
acting
because
the
risks
of
inaction
would
be
far
greater
in
one
year
or
five
years
the
power
of
iraq
to
inflict
harm
on
all
free
nations
would
be
multiplied
many
times
over
with
these
capabilities
saddam
hussein
and
his
terrorist
allies
could
choose
the
moment
of
deadly
conflict
when
they
are
strongest
we
choose
to
meet
that
threat
now
where
it
arises
before
it
can
appear
suddenly
in
our
skies
and
cities
the
cause
of
peace
requires
all
free
nations
to
recognize
new
and
undeniable
realities
in
the
20th
century
some
chose
to
appease
murderous
dictators
whose
threats
were
allowed
to
grow
into
genocide
and
global
war
in
this
century
when
evil
men
plot
chemical
biological
and
nuclear
terror
a
policy
of
appeasement
could
bring
destruction
of
a
kind
never
before
seen
on
this
earth
terrorists
and
terror
states
do
not
reveal
these
threats
with
fair
notice
in
formal
declarations
and
responding
to
such
enemies
only
after
they
have
struck
first
is
not
selfdefense
it
is
suicide
the
security
of
the
world
requires
disarming
saddam
hussein
now
as
we
enforce
the
just
demands
of
the
world
we
will
also
honor
the
deepest
commitments
of
our
country
unlike
saddam
hussein
we
believe
the
iraqi
people
are
deserving
and
capable
of
human
liberty
and
when
the
dictator
has
departed
they
can
set
an
example
to
all
the
middle
east
of
a
vital
and
peaceful
and
selfgoverning
nation
the
united
states
with
other
countries
will
work
to
advance
liberty
and
peace
in
that
region
our
goal
will
not
be
achieved
overnight
but
it
can
come
over
time
the
power
and
appeal
of
human
liberty
is
felt
in
every
life
and
every
land
and
the
greatest
power
of
freedom
is
to
overcome
hatred
and
violence
and
turn
the
creative
gifts
of
men
and
women
to
the
pursuits
of
peace
that
is
the
future
we
choose
free
nations
have
a
duty
to
defend
our
people
by
uniting
against
the
violent
and
tonight
as
we
have
done
before
america
and
our
allies
accept
that
responsibility
good
night
and
may
god
continue
to
bless
america
